Project Description:
EvaS (ExtraVehicular Activity Search) allows the user to search NASA's database of extravehicular activity according to the inputted/selected parameters. The user also has the option to display all the recorded EVAs. This project is intended as a gateway into further research. It is simple to use and allows the user to easily locate the data they need, and thus providing them with the resources to continue their exploration. An example of this would be a young child looking to know what spacewalks (EVAs) happened in 2010. Upon using EvaS, the child would have some data on those specific spacewalks and could then search the Internet to learn more.
